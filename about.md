### More Information

I'm a twenty three year old Vietnamese born in Budapest, Hungary. I got my Computer Engineering BSc at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in 2014 and started my graduate studies at the Georgia Institute of Technology later in the Fall.

I am mainly interested in High Performance Computing, Computer Graphics and Theory of Computing. I enjoy projects that combine multiple of these aspects.
