title: OpenGL: The chickens and the road-roller
categories : [projects]
---

This was our 4th and 5th project in our Computer Graphics course at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. First we had to build up the scene, allowing us to correctly master the usage of OpenGL. We also had to generate textures procedurally and use them. 

The second part of the project was to make this scene alive. We had to add a changing light source, multiple cameras, interaction between the actors, implement inverse kinematics for the chickens' steps and to prevent skids of the roller.

This was a really fun project and I learnt a lot about building up scenes in 3D space.
