This was our 3rd project in our Computer Graphics course at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Our task was to implement ray tracing with Fresnel re-fracturing and specular lights.

This project was really hard, because reaching the point where we could produce visible results is difficult and it is not easy to debug blindly. I had to analyse the lecture notes and my code thoroughly to catch each and every bug until I was able to get a debugable image. My efforts were also hindered by the fact that every rerun of the code took 1-2 minutes to produce the image. This assignment was really challenging and sometimes quite frustrating, but it was by far the most spectacular one I had the chance to work on, so in the end it was all worth it.
